## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod that adds an extra NPC (Sandra) in a very interesting way.  It also acts as a template for those who wish to install a NPC in a new and interesting way.  Currently, Sandra has dialogue for joining and leaving, some very interesting banter dialog that might result in some special circumstances, a special surprise for Imoen, and a few Interjections done.
